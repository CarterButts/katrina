Updates:
  - Updated R package structure to comply with current R versions.
  - Updated author contact information, and ensured that the package citations
    reflect the original JoSS citation (they previously reflected the
    anticipated citation at acceptance, but there was a large lag between
    this and the final publication).
  - Configured for hosting on GitHub.
